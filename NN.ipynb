    "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a popular machine learning model inspired by the biological neural networks in our brains. As with other machine learning models, by fitting the models with input data with labeled outputs the neural network can \"learn\" the function that maps the input to the output, and extrapolate to new examples.  \n",

    "Sometimes we might change the shape of the vector to be a multidimensional array instead instead of a simple array. We may then think of the vector as a **tensor**.  \n",
